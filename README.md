# ermify

## What it does
It's a simple Flask application that just makes all your text the "british people when you say"
Like the "British people when you say "trick or treat" instead of "ludicrous tomfoolery or delectable sweets""
For example, if you input "Where are you?" it'll return "Could I perchance be enlightened with information regarding your whereabouts?" 

## How to use it
Download the repo, set up a virtualenv, download gemini api with `pip install -q -U google-generativeai`, and replace the variable "apikey" with your gemini api key. They're free!
Then just run the app.

Type the text you want to "ermify", and just hit the "ermify" button. It'll generate it for you!

I wanted to make an actual demo link for this but Gemini API has been very slow for me for a while :(
